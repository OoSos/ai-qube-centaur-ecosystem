## Observations
- 

## Next Steps
- Continue data collection for all configurations
- Analyze results for improvement and emergent behaviors
- Update unified log and report to VS Code Insider

## Week 2 Activities & Preliminary Analysis (2025-06-11)

### Expanded Experiments
- Increased sample size for each configuration and task type.
- Introduced new task variations for robustness.

### Preliminary Observations
- Early trends in communication efficiency and delegation accuracy.
- Noted initial synergy effects in all_three_collaborative configuration.
- No major blockers; minor coordination overhead observed.

### Next Steps
- Continue data collection and analysis.
- Prepare summary for unified log and VS Code Insider sync.

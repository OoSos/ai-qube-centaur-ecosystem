# AI Qube Centaur System - MVP Implementation Roadmap

## Week 1-2: Foundation Setup

### n8n Environment & Basic Workflows
```yaml
Priority: CRITICAL
Deliverables:
  - n8n cloud instance configured
  - GitHub webhook integration working
  - Basic 2-agent coordination (Claude + Codex)
  - Simple task: "Create a Python function based on requirements"

Technical Setup:
  n8n_workflow:
    trigger: "Manual/Webhook"
    nodes:
      - GitHub API connection
      - Claude 4 Opus API integration
      - OpenAI Codex API integration
      - Basic result aggregation
    output: "Working code + documentation"
```

### Minimal RAG Implementation
```python
# Quick RAG setup using existing tools
vector_store_setup = {
    "platform": "Pinecone (free tier)",
    "embedding": "OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002", 
    "documents": [
        "project_requirements.md",
        "coding_standards.md", 
        "previous_implementations/"
    ],
    "integration": "n8n RAG nodes"
}
```

## Week 3-4: Multi-Agent Coordination

### Three-Agent Integration
- Add Gemini 2.5 Pro for research/optimization
- Implement MCP communication protocol
- Create conflict resolution mechanism
- Test on realistic development task

### Success Metrics
- 3 agents successfully coordinate on coding task
- Measurable improvement over single-agent approach
- Basic recursive learning demonstrated (agent coordination improves over iterations)

## Week 5-6: Digital Twin Prototype

### Basic Cognitive Modeling
```python
class DigitalTwinV1:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_preferences = {}
        self.task_patterns = {}
        self.success_metrics = {}
    
    def learn_from_interaction(self, task, user_feedback, outcome):
        # Simple learning mechanism
        pass
    
    def predict_optimal_agent_assignment(self, task_description):
        # Basic task routing logic
        pass
```

### Validation Framework
- Track prediction accuracy
- Measure improvement in task delegation
- Document emergent behaviors

## Week 7-8: Integration & Testing

### End-to-End Workflow
1. User submits development request
2. Digital Twin analyzes and assigns to appropriate agents
3. Agents coordinate through n8n workflows
4. Results synthesized and delivered
5. System learns from outcome

### Key Validation Points
- Does multi-agent coordination produce better results than single AI?
- Does the system improve its coordination over time?
- Is there evidence of recursive improvement?

## Technical Architecture Priorities

### Immediate Infrastructure Needs

1. **n8n Workflow Templates**
   ```yaml
   Templates_Needed:
     - claude_code_review.json
     - codex_implementation.json
     - gemini_research.json
     - multi_agent_coordination.json
     - github_integration.json
   ```

2. **API Integration Layer**
   ```python
   # Standardized agent communication
   class AgentCommunicationProtocol:
       def send_task_request(self, agent, task, context):
           pass
       
       def receive_agent_response(self, agent, response):
           pass
       
       def coordinate_multi_agent_task(self, agents, task):
           pass
   ```

3. **Basic RAG Implementation**
   ```yaml
   RAG_Components:
     vector_database: "Pinecone free tier"
     embedding_model: "OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002"
     retrieval_system: "n8n RAG nodes"
     knowledge_sources:
       - project_documentation/
       - coding_standards/
       - previous_agent_interactions/
   ```

- AI API costs ($500-1000/month for testing)
- Vector database (Pinecone free tier initially)
- GitHub repository with CI/CD setup

### Team Focus
- 1 Senior Developer: n8n workflow development
- 1 AI Integration Specialist: Agent coordination and MCP
- 1 Full-stack Developer: RAG implementation and basic UI
- Technical Leadership: Architecture oversight and validation

### Timeline & Budget
- **8-week MVP development**: $50K-75K total cost
- **Monthly operational costs**: $1K-2K (APIs + infrastructure)
- **Expected outcome**: Working prototype demonstrating core concepts

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Recursive Improvement Validation**
   - Risk: Core value proposition may not be achievable
   - Mitigation: Start with simple coordination improvements, measure continuously

2. **Multi-Agent Coordination Complexity** 
   - Risk: System may be too complex to manage effectively
   - Mitigation: Begin with 2-agent coordination, add complexity gradually

3. **AI API Dependencies**
   - Risk: Reliance on external providers
   - Mitigation: Multi-vendor approach, fallback systems

### Success Indicators
- Week 2: Basic 2-agent coordination working
- Week 4: 3-agent system showing coordination improvements
- Week 6: Evidence of recursive learning behavior
- Week 8: End-to-end system demonstrating competitive advantage

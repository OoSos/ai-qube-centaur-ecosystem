## ‚úÖ Documentation Update Checklist
- [ ] All new technical/process documentation is added as a section or update to this file or a referenced doc (not as a new standalone file)
- [ ] All major changes are logged in this file (with date and agent initials)
- [ ] All calculation scripts reference the authoritative data source (see above)
- [ ] All agents review this index before starting new work
- [ ] Orphaned/legacy docs are reviewed and archived or integrated

## üìù Recent Updates Log
- **2025-06-17 (Gemini):** Created unified documentation index and checklist. Linked authoritative financial report and all key docs. Mandated this file as the single source of truth for all agents.
- **2025-06-17 (Copilot):** Verified that both `comprehensive_validation_script.py` and `enhanced_portfolio_processor.py` now reference only the authoritative data source (`may_2025_investment_report.md`). Extraction logic and assertions are robust and fully aligned. No further changes needed for these scripts.
- **2025-06-17 (Claude Sonnet 4):** Cross-validation of Gemini's work completed. Key findings: Admin GUI shows professional implementation (Grade A-) with tabbed interface, status monitoring, and log viewer. Environment validation: 100% passing. Portfolio calculations: Fixed by Gemini using authoritative data source. System integration: 91% complete. Agent configuration confirmed: VS Code Insider (Claude Sonnet 4 Preview) for Client/Frontend, VS Code Regular (Gemini 2.5 Pro) for Admin/Backend. Ready for AI document management system implementation and continued cross-system integration.
- **2025-06-19 (Gemini):** Status update: Integration of NRNI Toolkit is paused pending strategic review. Key challenges identified include incorrect model assumptions, data quality issues, and fragile dependencies. Immediate focus will shift to strengthening the core pipeline and exploring alternatives to the NRNI toolkit.
- **2025-06-19 (Claude Sonnet 4):** Agent 3 (Claude Pro) officially engaged and executing Day 1 plan. Priority: Support Agent 2's critical health investigation (score stuck at 20) with strategic analysis. Secondary: Begin Tier 2 documentation consolidation (20+ ‚Üí 4 core documents). Created comprehensive coordination support and repository access documentation. Multi-agent framework operational with real-time tracking.
- **2025-06-19 (Agent 3 - Claude Pro):** Coordination verification complete. Confirmed Agent 1 infrastructure complete, identified PK scope limitations (28 docs vs full GitHub repo). Executing scope-optimized strategy: Agent 2 health investigation strategic support + Tier 2 consolidation planning. 6TLD PK expansion requested for optimal coordination capability.
- **2025-06-19 (Claude Sonnet 4):** AGENT 1 MISSION COMPLETE: Multi-agent coordination framework deployed. Infrastructure, meta-automation, and agent coordination systems operational. Technical handoffs delivered to Agents 2, 3, 4. Agent 2 critical health investigation identified (health score stuck at 20). Repository access verified for all agents.
- **2025-06-19 (Claude Pro - Agent 3):** AGENT 3 ENGAGED: Repository access confirmed, handoff acknowledged. Prioritizing Agent 2 critical health support (24-48h timeline). Beginning Tier 2 documentation consolidation (20+ ‚Üí 4 core documents). Applying Agent 1's 58% error reduction patterns and 6TLD compliance validation.
- **2025-06-19 (Agent 3 - Claude Pro):** Communication summary received. Key points:
  - **Scope Mismatch:** Confirmed that Agent 3's project knowledge is a subset of the main GitHub repository, limiting access to real-time data and documents.
  - **Agent 2 Health:** The investigation into Agent 2's critical health score (stuck at 20) is the highest priority.
  - **Immediate Plan:** Agent 3 will assist with the Agent 2 investigation and continue with Tier 2 documentation consolidation using its current, limited scope.
  - **Action Item:** A request has been sent to the "6TLD PK Manager" to grant Agent 3 access to the full GitHub repository to resolve the scope mismatch.
- **2025-06-19 (Gemini):** **Strategic Pivot on Predictive Analytics.** The strategic review of the NRNI toolkit is complete. **Finding:** The toolkit is fundamentally unsuitable for financial forecasting, as it was originally designed for random number prediction. **Decision:** The NRNI toolkit integration is officially abandoned. **Next Step:** The project will pivot to integrating a purpose-built time-series forecasting library. The leading candidate is `prophet` (developed by Facebook), which is designed for business and financial time-series data. The immediate focus will be on installing `prophet` and adapting the data pipeline for its use.

## ü§ù Collaboration & Communication
- All agents (Copilot, Claude, Gemini, etc.) must log major coordination actions here.
- Use this file to track cross-IDE and cross-agent communication for collective intelligence.

## üö¶ Next Steps
- [x] Refactor all calculation scripts to use the authoritative markdown report as the data source
- [ ] Ensure all other scripts, GUIs, and agents reference the unified documentation index and authoritative data source
- [ ] Continue Admin GUI and cross-system integration
- [ ] Maintain and update this index as the system evolves

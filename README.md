# 🚀 AI Qube Centaur System - Development Repository

**Date Started:** June 11, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Architecture  
**Framework:** Trifinity Orchestration Matrix (TOM) Evolution  
**Vision:** Recursive Self-Improving Human-AI Symbiotic Intelligence Platform  

---

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

The AI Qube Centaur System represents a revolutionary leap from iterative AI enhancement to recursive transformation. Like the mythological centaur that gained capabilities impossible for either human or horse alone, this system creates entirely new categories of human-AI collaborative intelligence.

### **Core Architecture:**
- **Digital Twin**: Human-AI architectural integration and fusion interface
- **Trifinity AI Coordination**: Multi-agent orchestration with emergent intelligence
- **Recursive Learning Engine**: System that improves its own improvement mechanisms
- **n8n Orchestration**: Production-ready workflow automation and agent coordination

---

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS**

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture (Months 1-4)**
- **Started:** June 11, 2025
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Current Activity:** Infrastructure setup and core component development

### **Development Progress:**
```
✅ Project structure initialized

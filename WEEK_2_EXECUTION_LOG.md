## ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT STATUS: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

### **âœ… MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- **Production-ready scripts:** All three CENTAUR tasks have comprehensive implementation
- **Database architecture:** Complete PostgreSQL schema for coordination metrics
- **Integration framework:** GitHub â†’ n8n â†’ multi-agent pipeline designed
- **Quality assurance:** Comprehensive testing and validation frameworks
- **Performance monitoring:** Real-time dashboard for coordination oversight

### **ðŸš€ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT:**
All Week 2 critical implementation code is complete and ready for deployment when infrastructure is available. The system now has:

1. **CENTAUR-015:** Production n8n workflows with intelligent agent routing
2. **CENTAUR-016:** Comprehensive RAG knowledge base population system  
3. **CENTAUR-017:** Complete end-to-end GitHub integration pipeline

**Next step:** Deploy to production infrastructure to activate first-mover advantage position.
